1. <b>Tweet analysis:</b>  Examine, clean, and visualize terms among ~2,000 tweets for two subjects.  Compare one subject against the other.  Present findings in a series of slides for a non-technical business audience.
2. <b>Press release analysis:</b> Examine, clean, and visualize terms in hundreds of provided press releases.  Using the labeled data, create a supervised model to classify the press releases as “technology” vs “non-technology”.  Using the model, score all other provided press releases.  Once scored, compare the two press release groups (technology/non) using frequencies, plots and/or dates.  Present findings in a series of slides for a non-technical business audience.
